\-Halt is the third iteration in a series of projects to emulate the look and feel of a terminal window. \-Its main purpose is to be used by games that seek to recreate classic roguelike experiences, but because of its flexibility it can be used for other projects as well. \-Halt is written in \-C++ and uses \-Open\-G\-L with the \-G\-L\-E\-W library. \-It is a simple, abstract renderer that allows the user to take the rendered results from the library and use them however he wants, whether it be rendering straight to the backbuffer or to an off-\/screen texture so that it can be used elsewhere.\hypertarget{index_Compilation}{}\section{\-Compilation}\label{index_Compilation}
\-Compiling the \-Halt library is up to you. \-I can only guarantee that the library works on \-Windows for now, but it should theoretically work on other platforms as \-I make no platform-\/specific calls anywhere in library code. \-I have done what \-I can to make the examples work in any compiler. \-Setting up your compiler is, once again, up to you.\hypertarget{index_Library}{}\subsection{\-Dependencies}\label{index_Library}
\-Halt itself requires the following libraries\-: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-Open\-G\-L \item \-G\-L\-E\-W\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{index_Example}{}\subsection{\-Dependencies}\label{index_Example}
\-The examples require the following libraries\-: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-Halt \item \-S\-D\-L\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{index_Usage}{}\section{\-Usage}\label{index_Usage}
\-In order to use \-Halt, you will need an \-Open\-G\-L 3.\-0 compatible context. \-There are multiple ways to do this, but you will have to determine which way suits your needs best. \-The examples use \-S\-D\-L to create the \-Open\-G\-L context and handle window messages. \-Alternatively, you can use \-S\-F\-M\-L and perhaps \-Allegro. \-Once the \-Open\-G\-L context is created, you need to include \hyperlink{_halt_8h_source}{\-Halt.\-h} and initialize \-Halt\-:

halt\-::\-Initialize();

\-Then you are free to create a \hyperlink{classhalt_1_1_terminal}{halt\-::\-Terminal} and use it as you like. \-Consult the examples and this documentation for more detailed information.
