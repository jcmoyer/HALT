# bro-bot

It's bro-bot without the bloat. This is a fork of Abjorn's bro-bot on #vidyadev.

## Installation

1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Copy the bro-bot files to a directory, or clone the repository somewhere.
3. Change the current directory to the one you copied bro-bot into. Run the install batch or shell script for your OS.
4. Configure the bot. See `config.js.example` for a sample config file. The new configuration file should be named `config.js` and should be located in the directory bro-bot is installed to (just above `bin` and `lib`).

## Usage

Simply run the corresponding `bro-bot` batch or shell script for your OS. Make sure the current directory is the one that you installed bro-bot to.
